I am a PhD student in Computer Science and Engineering at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, advised by [Prof. Farzan Farnia](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/people/faculty/farzan-farnia/). My research focuses on evaluating and improving generative models, as well as advancing the field of formal mathematics.

I was a member of the first graduating cohort in the “Artificial Intelligence: Systems & Technologies” program at CUHK. Before beginning my PhD, I interned at MetaSystems Asia, working on applied computer vision solutions for healthcare.

My main research interests include:

- Spectral Theory: Applying spectral methods to generative model evaluation and improving output sampling

- Formal Mathematics: Using Lean 4 for autoformalization and formal theorem proving
